        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy establishes the use of the following mobile applications, created and maintained by Diego Atencia, listed at Portfolio tab.</p>

        <h2>What information does the app obtain and how is it used?</h2>
        <h3>Information provided by the user</h3>
        <p>The application does not require any type of registration, but it does require the user to maintain an Apple App Store (iOS) account to download the application(s) and use its services.</p>
        <h3>Information obtained automatically</h3>
        <p>Additionally, the application may automatically collect other types of information, such as: type of mobile device, country of the user, operating system of the mobile device and information on how the application is used, such as the actions that the user performs within the same.</p> 
        
        <h2>Does the app get accurate and real-time information from the device?</h2>
        <p>The app does not collect accurate, real-time device location information at any time. It only gets information relevant to the continuous improvement of the application, such as performance metrics.</p>

        <h2>Can third parties gain access to the information obtained by the app?</h2>
        <p>Yes. I can share information provided by the user or obtained automatically in the following cases: when required by law, when we believe it is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or in response to a government request, with suppliers who work on our behalf and who have agreed to be bound by the rules set forth in this privacy policy, or with third-party advertisers and ad networks, as described in the “Information obtained automatically” section.</p>

        <h2>Automatic data collection and advertising</h2>
        <p>I can work with advertisers and third-party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with the advertising present in the application, who help keep prices low. Advertisers and advertiser networks may use some of the information collected by the App. Sensitive information will never be shared with them.</p>

        <h2>Information retention and handling policy</h2>
        <p>I retain user-provided and automatically collected data indefinitely as it is needed for the correct use of the application. The information collected will not make distinctions between users, that is, the information cannot be associated with a particular user.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>I care about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information, so I have the necessary measures to achieve this goal. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know such information to operate, develop, or improve our application. Please note that although I strive to provide a reasonable level of security for handling and processing information, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our privacy policy by posting the new privacy policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>Your consent</h2>
        <p>By using our services, you are consenting us to process and collect information from you, as set in our Privacy Policy. “Processing” means the use of cookies or information in any manner, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, combining, using and disclosing information, all activities to be conducted in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S., your information will be transferred, processed and stored in that country.</p>
